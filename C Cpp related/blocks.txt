A compound statement (also called a block, or block statement) is a group of zero or more statements that is treated by the compiler 
as if it were a single statement.

Blocks inside other blocks
Although functions can’t be nested inside other functions, blocks can be nested inside other blocks:
code:
int add(int x, int y)
{ // block
    return x + y;
} // end block

int main()
{ // outer block

    // multiple statements
    int value {};

    { // inner/nested block
        add(3, 4);
    } // end inner/nested block

    return 0;

} // end outer block

NESTING LEVEL :
The nesting level (also called the nesting depth) of a function is the maximum number of nested blocks you can be inside at any point 
in the function (including the outer block). In the above function, there are 4 blocks, but the nesting level is 3 since in this 
program you can never be inside more than 3 blocks at any point.
**NOTE** : The C++ standard says that C++ compilers should support 256 levels of nesting -- however not all do (e.g. as of the time of 
writing, Visual Studio supports fewer).
code:
#include <iostream>
int main()
{ // block 1, nesting level 1
    std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
    int value {};
    std::cin >> value;

    if (value >  0)
    { // block 2, nesting level 2
        if ((value % 2) == 0)
        { // block 3, nesting level 3
            std::cout << value << " is positive and even\n";
        }
        else
        { // block 4, also nesting level 3
            std::cout << value << " is positive and odd\n";
        }
    }

    return 0;
}

Best practice
Keep the nesting level of your functions to 3 or less. If your function has a need for more nested levels, consider refactoring your 
function into sub-functions.
