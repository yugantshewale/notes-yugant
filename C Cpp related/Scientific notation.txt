In scientific notation in c++
Consider number 5972200000000000000000000 that’s a really large number (too big to fit even in an 8 byte integer)
In scientific notation, this would be written as 5.9722 x 10²⁴ kg, which is much easier to read.
Because it can be hard to type or display exponents in C++, we use the letter ‘e’ (or sometimes ‘E’) to represent 
the “times 10 to the power of” part of the equation. For example, 1.2 x 10⁴ would be written as 1.2e4, and 5.9722 x 10²⁴ 
would be written as 5.9722e24.
For numbers smaller than 1, the exponent can be negative. The number 5e-2 is equivalent to 5 * 10⁻², which is 5 / 10², 
or 0.05. The mass of an electron is 9.1093837e-31 kg.

***Some math ***
Significant digits

Let’s say you need to know the value of the mathematical constant pi for some equation, but you’ve forgotten. 
You ask two people. One tells you the value of pi is 3.14. The other tells you the value of pi is 3.14159. 
Both of these values are “correct”, but the latter is far more precise.

Here’s the most important thing to understand about scientific notation: The digits in the significand (the part before the ‘e’) are called the significant digits (or significant figures). The more significant digits, the more precise a number is.
