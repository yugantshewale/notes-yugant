The interviewer started with networking then operating system then DBMS and at last DSA , each in depth along with many 
questions in between .

Difference between hashmap and map Give the real life example of polymorphism

twosum, best time to buy stock and hashmap.

 If you do the proper basic of CPP and Linux you can crack the IV very easily.
 Technology on which interview was held is Linux and C++

Online assessment had MCQ's on c++ and two coding questions 1) Merge Two Sorted Arrays 
2) Minimum Taps to open to water garden

Dynamic Programming based simple question and Data Structure based algorithmic question

Mostly about modern C++ and some algorithms.
